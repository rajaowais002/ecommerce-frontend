Also, there is a possibility that it will support fast charging as well. At the backside, the Xiaomi C75 offers you a Dual setup of 50 MP + Auxiliary lens for iconic shots; there is also an 13 MP selfie snapper. The users will have options of 6/8GB RAM and 256GB internal memory, so they can choose among them according to their needs.
